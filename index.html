      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p id="paragraph">Josipa Lisac (born 14 February 1950, Zagreb) is a prominent Croatian pop-rock singer. A child of exceptional musical talent, at the age of 10 she became a member of the Croatian Radiotelevision (HRT) Choir. Singing a serious musical repertoire, from old sacred songs, through classical and modern avant-garde, all the way to ethno-traditional music, she received her first and later much richer musical education. Not only with her mesmerising voice (which ranges from contralto to soprano) and original interpretations but equally so with her unique and intriguing appearance, Josipa Lisac quickly became a recognised rock star. Developing and persistently going against all conventional norms, she developed her unique style of musical expression.</p> 
<p id="paragraph">Her first solo album, Dnevnik jedne ljubavi (The Diary of a Love), recorded in 1973, was a huge success and remains today one of the most legendary albums in Croatia and in the region. Her acquaintance, friendship and love with the popular rock ‘n’ roll singer and songwriter Karlo Metikoš (Matt Collins) completely encompassed her music and life. Metikoš’s experience and powerful authorial personality shaped Josipa Lisac into a unique artist and woman.</p> 
<p id="paragraph">Aside from the uniqueness of her voice and her commitment to music, which is her passion and her life, Josipa also built her strong artistic individuality through her visual recognisability. Her hairstyles, the fashion designs in which she appeared and the make-up which went along with them, as a rule, provoked attention.</p>
